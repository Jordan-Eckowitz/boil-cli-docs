## Installation

Install the Boil CLI tool globally using either `npm` or `yarn`.

```sh
npm install -g boil-cli-tool
```

```sh
yarn global add boil-cli-tool
```

## Version

After you've installed the CLI tool you can validate that it was installed successfully by running this command.

```sh
boil --version
```

## Help

If you're stuck, or just want to see what features the CLI tool has, you can use the `--help` flag at anytime.

This is for the general help menu (showing all available commands). See **[here](commands.md)** for more information on all the available commands.

```sh
boil --help
```

This is to get more focused help for individual commands.

```sh
boil [COMMAND] --help, e.g. boil create --help
```
